# Satellite-Image-Data-Processor

This project covers the basics of image processing using Matplotlib and NumPy. The objectives are to:

1. Convert an image into grayscale.
2. Plot the grayscale image with its histogram to be able to visualize the distribution of pixel intensities.
   
Style the visualization, so the plot becomes more readable and presentable. Features include:

1. Grayscale conversion using the standard formula for RGB to grayscale transformation.
2. Plotting and displaying the grayscale image with a colorbar to represent the intensity of pixels.
3. Histogram visualization of the frequency of the different pixel intensities of the image. Custom styling includes bold and colored titles, and grid lines with annotations on the histogram.

The output will pop up in a window displaying:

1. Original grayscale image with colorbar showing pixel intensity.
2. A histogram graph showing the distribution of pixel brightness values.
